## About me

> <small>Just normal human trying to make Photography Blog. </small>

To be fair, there isn't much that you couldn't already glean for yourself reading my musings here on the website, but for the sake of completeness, an attempt will be made.

We can focus on personality attributes, in which case, I'm usually pissed at something one way or another. My entire identity revolves around that fact - my wanting to fix them, be it inanimate objects or even humans.
